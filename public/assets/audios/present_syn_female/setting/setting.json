The upper section features the faded text 'Earlsfield Wimbledon' with a leftward arrow, along with a London Network and bicycle logo on the right. The lower section displays the faded text 'Balham Streatham' with a rightward arrow, accompanied by a London Network and bicycle logo on the left. The bottom sign depicts a faded image of a bicycle.

Will that work for you?' Sally informs him that she will be gone by then, leaving the box on the front porch. He agrees, inquiring about the payment for the glasses.",
